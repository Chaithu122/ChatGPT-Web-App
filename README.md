## 🤖 ChatGPT Web App

## 🎯 Objective

To build a simple and interactive AI chat interface using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to communicate with the OpenAI ChatGPT model directly from the browser.

## 📘 Description

This project is a web-based ChatGPT application that uses a Node.js backend to securely handle API requests and a HTML, CSS, JavaScript frontend to display the chat interface.
Users can type messages into the chat UI, and the message is sent to the backend where it is forwarded to the OpenAI ChatGPT API. The AI's response is then returned and displayed in the browser in real time, creating a smooth and interactive conversational experience.
